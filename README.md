## About myself

Hi, My name is Sohan Thakur. I work as a Big Data Engineer for AWS.
I am currently pursuing masters in Data Science from Bellevue University (Nebraska)
I have acquired extensive experience in designing and developing highly scalable Analytical platfoorms using Big Data.
My experiecne in Data Science and Machine Learning is a mix of use cases that I worked on during my tenure at American Express and use cases that I have worked on during my Master's in Data Science course in Bellevue University.

You can visit my github repository for my project details : [My repository](https://github.com/sthakur2019)

## Work/Project details:

### Few of the use cases that I have worked at are:

### Customer churn prediction.
  As part of this project my primary goal is to predict the event of cancellation for a customer. This is a typial classification problem with 2 classes: Active and   Cancel. Data contains major demographic details , financial health related attributes and some market and general informational attributes for each customer. The   major challenge in this use case is skewness in Class. We have almost 96% customer as Active and 4% as cancelled as a result finding out the accurate 4%     
  population with least false positive is a real challenge here. I have used various algorithms like Logistic regression, Decision tree classifier and Random forest   classifier for this use case. Random Forest regressor produced results with less false positive i.e best precision score.
