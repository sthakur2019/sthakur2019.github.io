## About myself

Hi, My name is Sohan Thakur. I work as a Big Data Engineer for AWS.
I am currently pursuing masters in Data Science from Bellevue University (Nebraska)
I have acquired extensive experience in designing and developing highly scalable Analytical platfoorms using Big Data.
My experiecne in Data Science and Machine Learning is a mix of use cases that I worked on during my tenure at American Express and use cases that I have worked on during my Master's in Data Science course in Bellevue University.

You can visit my github repository for my project details : [My repository](https://github.com/sthakur2019)

## Work/Project details:

## Few of the use cases that I have worked at are:

### Customer churn prediction
  As part of this project my primary goal is to predict the event of cancellation for a customer. This is a typial classification problem with 2 classes: Active and   Cancel. Data contains major demographic details , financial health related attributes and some market and general informational attributes for each customer. The   major challenge in this use case is skewness in Class. We have almost 96% customer as Active and 4% as cancelled as a result finding out the accurate 4%     
  population with least false positive is a real challenge here. I have used various algorithms like Logistic regression, Decision tree classifier and Random forest   classifier for this use case. Random Forest regressor produced results with less false positive i.e best precision score.
  
### Recommendation system
  This use case is meant to address the use case where a buyer and supplier in a B2B domain needs to be connected. I need to reccomend the potential supplier for a   buyer and vice versa. There are various business logic around this use case that restrict recommending certain buyers to certain supplier. Thus, we need to come    up with an optimal recommendation under the given boundaries. The success of this tool will be measured by how much revenue did recommended pair of buyer and   supplier generated in next 3 months. The solution was done by calculating most similar buyer to a given buyer suing cosine similarity score and then recommending the suppliers of the similar buyers.
  
### Anomaly detection in time series data
  Problem statement for this use case is to find out the anomalies in daily financial volume of a customer. The data is available for last 3 years using which I need to find the anomalies in next 30days. I used Facebook Prophet for this use case to find the anomaly at daily level time series data.

### Median Home Price prediction
  Use case is to predict the median house prices in Arizona in next 12 months based on last 10 years of data. Added goal would be to provide some insights into for first 3 months of 2022 for new listings and inventory. Facebook prophet has been used to predict the median housing price.
  
### Analyze the impact of health infrastructure on disease severity for COVID 19.
  This use case is to present an extensive study of the health infrastructure among different states in USA and analyze it's impact on Covid severity. The severity is being represented by number of deaths in a given state. As part of this use case, I did perform Exploratory data analysis using COVID 19 data at state level and also the health infrastructure data in different state. 
  
### TMDB Moview review prediction
  Goal of this use case is to predict the movie review of a yet to be released movie based on it's characteristics like casts, titel, genre etc. This is a typical regression problem where moview rating (1-10) is to be predicted based on historical movie rating data.

### Airline safety Analytics
  With few airline accidents, there has been a general sense in the market that airline travel poses highest risk for travel. The purpose of this use case is to statistically prove and present the fact that Airline indded is the safest way to travel when compared to road(car) and waterways(ships and yachts).

### Predict the hazardous score of a house 
  Predict the hazardous score of a house based on the various features of the house. Task is to predict a transformed count of hazards or pre-existing damages using a dataset of property information. This will enable the insurance companies to more accurately identify high risk homes that require additional examination to confirm their insurability.

### Study the impact of COVID on online learning
  The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. The challenge is to explore 
  (1) the state of digital learning in 2020 and 
  (2) how the engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.
